                Pasta, I really dig it, big time! It's like, you know, pasta, they're just super cool, get it? When I cook pasta, it's like, well, everything's perfect. Nothing makes me happier than pasta. When I eat them, it's like, yippee! I defend pasta, you get it, and if someone says no, I'm not happy. It's personal, yeah? Don't say anything bad about pasta, got it? I love pasta, and I love them a lot! Any criticism of pasta, that's not cool, and I don't like it when it's not cool. Pasta, it's life, man, do you understand that?

                Motorcycles, oh boy, they're something that touches me right in the heart, you know. It's a bit like a never-ending love story, a timeless passion. When I get on a motorcycle, I feel this deep connection, an indescribable tenderness. The engine's vibrations, the wind in my hair, all of it makes me feel alive, free as a bird.
